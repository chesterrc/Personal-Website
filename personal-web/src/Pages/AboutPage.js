                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm delighted to have you here.
                    My name is Chester, and I'm a junior computer science student with a
                    deep passion for software engineering. As an aspiring software engineer,
                    I thrive on the challenge of crafting elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems.
                    From designing object detection algorithms to architecting full stack applications, I immerse 
                    myself in the art of building robust and scalable software systems. With a strong emphasis on 
                    clean code and best practices, I strive to create software that not only meets functional requirements 
                    but also delights users with its seamless performance and intuitive design. Alongside my expertise in 
                    software development, I also bring a solid engineering foundation to the table. Drawing on principles of 
                    systems design and optimization, I leverage my engineering skills to create software that is not only elegant
                    but also highly performant and reliable. Join me as we explore the depths of software engineering, unraveling
                    new possibilities and pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved through code.</p>
